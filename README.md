I'm a PhD researcher at the University of Oxford, with a background in Natural Sciences (University of Exeter) and a specialisation in machine learning. I'm experienced in and excited about interdisciplinary scientific work and want to use my knowledge and skills to have a real-world impact. I firmly believe that the better we understand the problems in front of us, the stronger our collective solutions will be. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on open-source tools for cleaning genetics data, and improving machine learning on DNA sequences
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), and how to make my own graphics in [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)
- ðŸ““ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects in [Explainable AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explainable_artificial_intelligence) and [Artificial Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_life)
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about novel nature-inspired ways of developing AI, the worlds simplest cookie recipe, and why I'm always [running away from zombies](https://zrx.app/zombies)!

I'm **currently looking for work** - so if you need a passionate programmer with a strong scientific background and enthusiasm to work alongside other passionate people, I'd love to hear from you!

Stay safe out there!
